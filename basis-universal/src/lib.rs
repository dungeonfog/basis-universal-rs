//! Bindings for Binomial LLC's basis-universal Supercompressed GPU Texture Codec
//!
//! basis-universal functionality can be grouped into two categories:
//!
//! * Encoding: Compresses and encode textures (optionally combining multiple images and mipmap
//!   layers in a single file/binary blob)
//! * Transcoding: Unpacks the texture into GPU-friendly compression formats. The final format can
//!   be chosen based on what the available GPU hardware can support.
//!
//! Encoding can be done ahead of time using a command line tool in the upstream repository.
//!
//! The encoded data can either be stored as a file or a binary blob. This data can include multiple
//! images, and each image can store multiple levels. This is commonly used for storing cube
//! textures and textures with precomputed mipmaps. This library also supports generating mipmaps
//! for you.
//!
//! Please refer to https://github.com/BinomialLLC/basis_universal for more details.
